    "1. **Credit Risk** is the likelihood that a borrower will not repay their loan.\n",
    "2. **Default** is the condition in which the borrower fails to repay their debt.\n",
    "3. Lenders can protect themselves by:\n",
    "   - Measuring credit risk accurately\n",
    "   - Requiring collateral\n",
    "   - Charging higher interest for riskier borrowers (**risk-based pricing**)\n",
    "4. Lenders understand that every borrower carries some degree of credit risk. Factors affecting expected loss include borrower-specific characteristics, the economic environment, or both.\n",

    "## Credit Risk Approaches under Basel Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking regulators (under Basel II and III) require banks to calculate **credit risk** using one of the following three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Standardized Approach (SA)\n",
    "- Uses regulator-defined risk weights.\n",
    "- Relies on external credit ratings (e.g., Moody’s, S&P).\n",
    "- Simpler and more conservative.\n",
    "- Typically used by smaller or less complex banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach (FIRB)\n",
    "- Banks estimate **Probability of Default (PD)** internally.\n",
    "- **Loss Given Default (LGD)** and **Exposure at Default (EAD)** are provided by regulators.\n",
    "- Requires supervisory approval and robust credit risk systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach (AIRB)\n",
    "- Banks internally estimate all components: **PD**, **LGD**, and **EAD**.\n",
    "- Offers more risk-sensitive capital requirements.\n",
    "- Requires the highest level of internal risk management and regulatory oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔒 Banks must get regulatory approval before using FIRB or AIRB.\n",
