# study-ml

Study notes, experiments, and important concepts in machine learning and deep learning.  
This repo is primarily for my own learning journey, but it may also serve as a reference for others exploring ML.

## About

- A collection of Jupyter notebooks covering:
  - **Statistical machine learning** (scikit-learn)
  - **Deep learning with TensorFlow**
  - **Deep learning with PyTorch**
- Focused on **learning, practicing, and documenting** core ideas.
- Serves as a personal knowledge base of important ML concepts, implementations, and experiments.

## Goals

- Learn by implementing key ML/DL techniques from scratch and with libraries.
- Keep a record of concepts I find useful or important.
- Build a resource I can return to when revisiting ideas.
- Share my learning process with others who might benefit.
